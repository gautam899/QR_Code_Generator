# QR_Code_Generator
This small project generates a QR code from the user-entered URL.
# Prerequisite
It would be best if you had node js installed in your system.
# How to run the project
1. Download the files as a zip file and open them in your favorite code editor.
2. If you try to run the index.js, it will give an error. This is happening because you do not have the required module as of now.
3. In the project we have two modules from the "npm" i.e. the node package manager. The first one is the "inquirer" and the second one is the "qr-image".
4. The "inquirer" module is used to take input from the user and the "qr-image" module is used to read a URL from the user and generate the corresponding QR code.
5. To install the above two modules type the following commands in the terminal-> "npm i inquirer qr-image" and press enter. Once you press enter a folder of the node modules will be installed and also a .json file.
